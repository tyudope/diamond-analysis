# 💎 Diamonds EDA Project

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the [Diamonds dataset](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html), which contains pricing and physical characteristics of over 50,000 diamonds.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to answer the question:

**"What drives diamond prices?"**

Through data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis, we explore how features such as:

- Carat
- Cut
- Color
- Clarity
- Physical Dimensions (`x`, `y`, `z`)
- Derived Volume

...influence the price of a diamond.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Carat** is the most influential factor in pricing.
- Higher carat values often correspond with lower cut/clarity.
- Derived **volume** correlates well with price after outliers are removed.
